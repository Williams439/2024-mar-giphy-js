## Description

This is the second Project of my coding bootcamp. In this project I am demostrating my skills in html, css, and javascript. The purpose of this project is to show that I can create a website that allows the user to search for images or Gifs and organize how they would like to view their search.

## User Stories

As a veteran meme gatherer I want to search for gifs quickly so I can use as them in reaction to things my friends send me.

As a business professional I want to find memes that will connect me to my younger employees.

As a webdesigner I want to find an effective way to search for memes in a streamlined manner.
